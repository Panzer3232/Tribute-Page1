         <h3>Here's a time line of Atal Bihari Vajapyee's life:</h3>
        <li>
           <p> <strong>1924</strong>-Vajpayee was born to Krishna Devi and Krishna Bihari Vajpayee on 25 December 1924 in Gwalior.His grandfather, Pandit Shyam Lal Vajpayee, had migrated to Morena, Gwalior from his ancestral village of Bateshwar, Uttar Pradesh.His father, Krishna Bihari Vajpayee, was a school teacher in his hometown.Vajpayee did his schooling at the Saraswati Shishu Mandir in Gwalior. In 1934, Atal Bihari was admitted to AVM School Barnagar Distt Ujjain after his father joined as headmaster. He spoke about his 'lifechanging moment’ at a public rally on the 1996 Lok Sabha election trail. He said “But I learned a lesson that changed my life. I took a pledge I’d never rote-learn a speech. It was my first speech at AVM (Anglo Vernacular Middle) School,”. He subsequently attended Gwalior's Victoria College (now Laxmi Bai College) and graduated with distinction in Hindi, English and Sanskrit. He completed his post-graduation with an M.A. in Political Science from DAV College, Kanpur, and was awarded a first-class degree.

            His activism started with Arya Kumar Sabha of Gwalior, the youth wing of the Arya Samaj, of which he became the general secretary in 1944. He also joined the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) as a swayamsevak, or volunteer, in 1939. Influenced by Babasaheb Apte, he attended the Officers Training Camp of the RSS during 1940–44 and became a pracharak, RSS terminology for a full-time worker, in 1947. He gave up studying law due to the partition riots. He was sent as a vistarak, a probationary pracharak, to Uttar Pradesh and quickly began working for the newspapers of Deendayal Upadhyaya, Rashtradharma (a Hindi monthly), Panchjanya (a Hindi weekly) and the dailies Swadesh and Veer Arjun.</p>

        <li><p>
               <strong >1942-1951</strong>- As a member of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, Atal Bihari Vajpayee was already politically active by the age of 16. He participated in the Quit India Movement in 1942 and was arrested with his brother for 23 days.

                In 1951, he started working for Bharatiya Jana Sangh, a political wing of RSS.
            </p>
            </li>
        <li><p>
               <strong> 1957</strong>- The year was a landmark in Vajpayee's career, as it marked his entry into the mainstream politics. In the Lok Sabha Elections that year, he contested from three seats --Lucknow, Mathura and Balrampur. While he lost in Mathura and Lucknow, he won in Balrampur and became a member of parliament.
            </p>
            </li>
        <li><p>
            <strong>1968</strong>-After the death of Jana Sangh co-founder Deendayal Upadhyaya in a train accident, Vajpayee took over the reins of the party and became the National President of the party.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li><p>
            <strong>1977</strong>-In 1975, Vajpayee was arrested along with other opposition leaders during the Emergency period imposed by then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. Later, in 1977 after the emergency was withdrawn, Jan Sangh merged with other opposition parties to form Janata Party, solely to oppose the rule of Indian National Congress. In the general elections that year, Janata Party emerged as the victor and formed a government led by Morarji Desai, India's first non-Congress prime minister. Vajpayee became the Minister of External Affairs on his cabinet.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li><p>
            <strong>1980</strong>- In 1977, Janata Party was dissolved after Morarji Desai resigned as prime minister. In 1980, Vajpayee joined L.K. Advani, Bhairon Singh Shekhawat and his other RSS, Jan Sangh colleagues to form Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and became the party's first president.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>1984</strong>-In the coming years, the party struggled and in fact in 1984 elections, BJP was left with only two seats in the Parliament. Vajpayee led the party during these years and supported the Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir Movement by RSS and Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP).
            </p>

        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>1994</strong>-BJP came into prominence again after a good performance in Karnataka Assembly Elections in 1994. The party won 40 seats out of 224 seats in the polls. Later in 1995, in Maharashtra and Gujarat assembly elections, the party again showed a good performance and won 65 seats and 121 seats in the states. This brought back Vajpayee and BJP into political centre stage in the country.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>1995-2004</strong>-In the general elections this year, BJP had the majority 161 seats and Vajpayee became the prime minister of India. However, the party was unable to get support from other parties to get more than 200 seats to form the government and therefore resigned after 13 days.
                BJP came back into power in 1998. The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) was formed and Vajpayee became the prime minister again. This government was dissolved after Jayalalithaa-led AIADMK withdrew its support after 13 months and the government came down. Vajpayee's some of the most notable achievements, nuclear tests in Pokhran were conducted in this term; and Lahore summit, too, took place during this period.
                In his third and final term as the prime minister, Vajpayee served for the full five years. While his term took off again with another crisis -- the Kandahar Hijack in December 1999 -- going ahead he brought some reforms which would pave the way for country's growth. The attack on Parliament in 2001 was another crisis Vajpayee had to battle during this term but his reformatory projects such as -- National highway project, encouraging private sector and foreign investments, reducing the minimum government holding in PSBs, introduction of Asset Reconstruction Companies -- were applauded.
                Against the general consensus, BJP lost 2004 General Elections to Congress-led UPA. In fact, the 13th Lok Sabha had been dissolved before the full-term as the BJP was confident it would come back to power again. However, the party witnessed a crushing defeat and Vajpayee refused to be the leader of opposition taking the responsibility of the defeat.

                <strong>Post-premiership</strong>-In December 2005, Vajpayee announced his retirement from active politics, declaring that he would not contest in the next general election. In a famous statement at the BJP's silver jubilee rally at Mumbai's Shivaji Park, Vajpayee announced that "Henceforth, Lal Krishna Advani and Pramod Mahajan will be the Ram-Laxman [the two godly brothers much revered and worshipped by Hindus] of the BJP."
                Vajpayee was referred to as the Bhishma Pitamah of Indian politics by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh during a speech in the Rajya Sabha, a reference to a mythological figure in the Hindu epic Mahabharata who was held in respect by two warring sides.
                Vajpayee was hospitalised at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi (AIIMS) for a chest infection and fever on 6 February 2009. He was put on ventilator support as his condition worsened but he eventually recuperated and was later discharged. Unable to participate in the campaign for the 2009 general election due to his poor health, he wrote a letter urging voters to back the BJP. His protege Lalji Tandon was able to retain the Lucknow seat in that election even though the NDA suffered electoral reverses all over the country. It was speculated that Vajpayee's non-partisan appeal contributed to Lalji's success in Lucknow in contrast to that BJP's poor performance elsewhere in Uttar Pradesh.

               <strong>Death</strong>-Vajpayee suffered a stroke in 2009 which impaired his speech.[147] His health had been a major source of concern; reports said he was confined to a wheelchair and failed to recognise people. He also suffered from dementia and long-term diabetes. For many years, he had not attended any public engagements and rarely ventured out of the house, except for checkups at the All India Institutes of Medical Sciences.

               On 11 June 2018, Vajpayee was admitted to AIIMS in critical condition following a kidney infection.He was officially declared dead there at 5:05 pm IST on 16 August 2018 at the age of 93. However some sources claim that he had passed away on the previous day.On the morning of 17 August, Vajpayee's body draped with the Indian flag was taken to the Bharatiya Janata Party headquarters where party workers paid their tributes till 1 p.m. Later that afternoon at 4 p.m., Vajpayee was cremated with full state honours at Rashtriya Smriti Sthal near Raj Ghat, his pyre was lit by his foster daughter Namita Kaul Bhattacharya.
